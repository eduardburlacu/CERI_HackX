            ## Purpose
            This app provides forecasting for the next 30 days for every county in the UK.
            To see the details about local risk, hover the cursor over the relevant region. By clicking, past data for infection rate is plotted in the section Plots. 
            ## Training Data
            The data was fetched from the Gov UK official site, attached here(coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download).
            For developers, a file containing all the training models and with extracted weight/bias values can be downloaded here.
            ## Why is it important
            If a new epidemic arises, it is important to localize regions with high potential of risk before it gets out of control,
            so preventive measures can be undertaken before cases start arising.
